Play as waiter in cafe and try to guess which cake a customer likes based on their appearance.
Textures are generated using StyleGAN2 models trained by Justin Pinkney:
https://github.com/justinpinkney/awesome-pretrained-stylegan2

To use Unity Sentis package that runs the models in Unity env, they have to be in ONNX format.
ONNX models can be downloaded here:

The models exceed github size limitations, so have to be downloaded separately and added to Resources directory in the project.
